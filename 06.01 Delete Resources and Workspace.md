## Exercise 5: Delete Resources and Workspace

In this lab you have successfully built an initial 2 zone environment, attached a load balancer, and optionally learned how to add an additional zone to the plan. To finish up with this lab, all you need to do now is delete your resources. You can also delete the Workspace if you choose to not keep it.

1. Select the "Delete" option in the Action Menu to begin the process.
