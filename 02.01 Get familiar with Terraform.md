## Exercise 1: Get Familiar with the Terraform Templates
Within the project, there are various files in which you will need to have familiarity with, as well as know which variables you will be required to specify values for.  Each of the files below are well documented to enhance your understanding of how the files work.

- **provider.tf** - Setup for the IBM Provider as well as the required credentials to be used.
- **variables.tf** - Holds the variables and possible default values to be used for the plan.
- **main.tf** - This file holds the majority of the resources to be created, including the VPC and virtual instances.
- **lb.tf** - This file holds the Load Balancer resource as well as defining the pool members. 
- **cloud-init-apptier.tf** - This file contains the Cloud-Init script to be used for each virtual instance to install a simple nginx service.
- **outputs.tf** - This file contains the output variables that we want to see when the plan is executed and completed.
